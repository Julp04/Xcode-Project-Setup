## Setup

### Versioning
Setup build and version numbers so that they can be auto incremented using [Fastlane](#fastlane)

![alt text](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1827/Art/QA1827_Versioning.png)

  Initially you are going to want to set: 

  Bundle versions string, short: `1.0.0`

  Bundle verison: `1`

### Environments
When setting up a new Xcode project you are going to want have at least two different environements
#### Development
Environement that will talk to your dev database / api with dummy data

#### Production
So when you are making changes and your app has been shipped to the app store you are not messing with user data that is out in production

#### Setting it up in Xcode
In order too have two environments you will need to create two different targets in your project. 
Under build settings select your target for your app and duplicate it

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/duplicate.png)

This will create a new target with named "appname copy" -> You should rename this to something like "appname-dev"

When you create this new target it will create another Info.plist for this specific target as well as give it a new BundleId

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/dev-infoplist.png)

After you have setup your new target, you are most likely going to want to set a flag so that you can run certain code for specifics environment

To add a flag go to Build Settings and in the search bar type "other swift flags"

Here you are gonna want to add a flag to determine that this is the development target. See below

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/swiftflags.png)

So now in your AppDelagate you can do something like this:

```swift
#if DEVELOPMENT
            let filePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "GoogleService-Info-DEV", ofType: "plist")!
            let options = FIROptions(contentsOfFile: filePath)
            FIRApp.configure(with: options!)
        #else
            let filePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "GoogleService-Info", ofType: "plist")!
            let options = FIROptions(contentsOfFile: filePath)
            FIRApp.configure(with: options!)
            Fabric.with([Crashlytics.self])
        #endif
```
Using [Firebase](#firebase) as backend service and configuring it up for dev and prod environments


## Tools

### [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/)<img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11098337?s=400&v=4" width="30" height="30">
> fastlane is an open source platform aimed at simplifying Android and iOS deployment.

> fastlane lets you automate every aspect of your development and release workflow.

#### Installing
Make sure you have latest verison of Xcode command line tools installed:

`xcode-select --install`

Install fastlane using 

`sudo gem install -fastlane -NV` 

or

`brew cask install fastlane`

#### Setting it up in your project
Navigate to project directory and run

`fastlane init`

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
CocoaPods are a very easy way to integreate different frameworks and packages into your project.
There are tons and tons of cocoapods out there that will save development hours for many different aspects of your project like:

* Custom Alert Views
* Custom Login Pages
* Setting up backend services like [Firebase](#firebase) or [Crashlytics](#crashlytics)
* Much, much more!

In order to use cocoapods in your project cd in your project directory and run

`pod init`

This will create a podfile that looks like this:

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/podfile.png)

#### Install pods
cd into your project director and run

`pod install`

This will create a new .xcworkspace file in your directory which you should now use from now on instead of .xcproj


### [Crashlytics](https://fabric.io/kits/ios/crashlytics/install)<img src="https://a.slack-edge.com/7f1a0/plugins/crashlytics/assets/service_512.png" width="30" height="30">

#### Install Crashlytics via CocoaPods
```
use_frameworks!
pod 'Fabric'
pod 'Crashlytics'
```

Run command 
`pod install`

#### Add a run script build phase

In the Project Navigator, click on your project and add a new run script build phase

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/crashlytics_script.gif)

`"${PODS_ROOT}/Fabric/run" <your-key-here>`

#### Add your API Key

In the Project Navigator, right click on "Info.plist", and "Open as" → "Source Code"

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/fabric_infoplist.gif)


```html
  <key>Fabric</key>
  <dict>
    <key>APIKey</key>
    <string>  <your-key-here> </string>
    <key>Kits</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>KitInfo</key>
        <dict/>
        <key>KitName</key>
        <string>Crashlytics</string>
      </dict>
    </array>
  </dict>
```

#### Initialize your kit

```swift
import UIKit
import Fabric
import Crashlytics

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
      Fabric.with([Crashlytics.self])
      return true
    }
}
```


### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)<img src="https://firebase.google.com/_static/images/firebase/touchicon-180.png" width="30" height="30">

### [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com)<img src="https://www.sketchapp.com/images/press/sketch-press-kit/app-icons/sketch-mac-icon@2x.png" width="30" height="30">
> Sketch is a design toolkit built to help you create your best work — from your earliest ideas, through to final artwork.

Layout the design of your app!

#### Sketchtool
Sketch tool  is an awesome command line tool that comes with Sketch. 

To make the best use of it, we are going to use a python script that will automatically import your Sketch slices into your Xcode Project.

First go [here](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/Other%20Files/slice.py) to download slice.py

Next, add it to your project directory, and create any named Sketch file (I name mine Design.sketch) and add it to the directory as well

<img src="https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/folder_sketch.png" width="600" height="400">

Now we need to add a new run script to your xcode project.

Select your project and select Build Phases

Hit the plus icon in the top left and select "New Run Script Phase"

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/new_runscript.png)

Add the script

`python "$PROJECT_DIR/slice.py" "$PROJECT_DIR/Design.sketch" "$PROJECT_DIR/Assets.xcassets"`

Make sure the script is placed before "Copy Bundle Resources" as seen below

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/sketch_script.png)

Now create your assets in your Design.sketch file. All images you want imported over have to be slices.

![alt text](https://github.com/Julp04/Xcode-Project-Setup/blob/master/images/sketch_editor.png)


When you build your project all slices that have been saved in Design.sketch will automatically import over
